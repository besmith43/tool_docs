# BASH

Bash is the Bourne Again SHell.
It is one of the most common shell interpreters for Unix based operating systems like Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD.
It was created back in 1989, so it has a long history.
This section is only designed as a reference manual for common tasks in bash and not a complete guide.
