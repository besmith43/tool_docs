# Git Configs

Git configs are plain text files that are either inside the hidden .git directory and thus git repo specific, or at the root of your home directory and global to your user account.
Generally speaking, these files contain the username and email used in the git commit entries, but they can do alot more.

As an example, here's the .git/config of this repo:

![contents of .git/config](/assets/images/repo_git_config.png)

And here's my personal global git config:

![contents of ~/.gitconfig](/assets/images/global_git_config.png)


### Git Global Config

Let's talk about setting up the global config.

To make one, you can either create the file and populate it yourself, or you can use git's config subcommand to do it for you.
Here we'll create the same ~/.gitconfig that I have pictured above.

```bash
	git config --global user.name "Blake Smith"
	git config --global user.email "besmith43@gmail.com"
```

You can also use this command without the '--global' flag to have it update the current repo's local .git/config file.
If you aren't in a git repo when you run the command, it'll give you an error for not being in one.
I recommend making sure that you're in the root of the git repo that you'd like to edit.


### Git Repo Specific Config

This is the config file inside each git repo's .git directory.
Most of this is autogenerated by git and something that you don't need to worry about.
However the [origin] section is really important as it defines where your remote is.
We'll talk about this in the next section.
