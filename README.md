# Tool Docs

The goal of this repo is to be an encyclopedia of knowledge for various tools that I use and need to share on a regular basis.
This is by no means guaranteed to be up to date or a declarative source of truth, but rather a decent starting point

### Always be Experimenting

Keep in mind that this documentation is a great starting point or reference, but the best way to learn anything is to experiment.
Use it.
Go out of your way to use it.
Play with it.
Read the docs, or the manual pages.
The goal is to integrate the knowledge such that it is second nature.
