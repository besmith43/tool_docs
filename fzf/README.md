# FZF

This tool is a fuzzy finder.  It can be used in a variety of ways, but the most basic option is to pipe in a list of options and use it to select display a menu to select from them.

```bash
	cat some_options_file | fzf
```

In this fashion, it is separating options by the presents of a new line.  So whitespace separated strings will be interpreted as a single option.
